# Welcome to BrahmWiki

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects and libraries, focusing on RTOS-based development for ESP32, ATmega328P, and ATmega2560 microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

-   **Libraries:** Explore the available libraries for communication and other peripherals.
-   **Microcontrollers:** Find specific information and examples for each supported microcontroller.

## Current Projects

-   **RTOS Blink Examples:** Simple "Blink LED" projects using a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for all three platforms, demonstrating the use of the custom serial library.

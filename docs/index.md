## Adding a New Library

Adding a new library to BrahmWiki is simple. Just follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new directory** for your library inside the appropriate category in the `lib/` directory (e.g., `lib/sensors/new_sensor`).
2.  **Add your source code** to a `src/` directory inside your new library's folder.
3.  **Add examples** for each supported platform to an `examples/` directory.
4.  **Create a `README.md`** file in your library's directory with documentation, wiring diagrams, and API references. You can use `lib/sensors/sensor_template/README.md` as a starting point.

Once you've created your library, submit a pull request, and we'll review it for inclusion in the collection.
